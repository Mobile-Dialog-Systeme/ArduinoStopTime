# ArduinoStopTime
An Arduino-based Timer to measure the race time of an autonomous robot. Version 1, using a directly controlled 7-segment display and a push-button. The push-button starts and stops the timer, the final time remains on the display until either the counter is re-started or a double-click is performed.
